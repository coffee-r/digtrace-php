# tekagami

`tekagami` creates runtime behavior evidence for specification discovery and migration review.

It observes what a running web application actually did and records that evidence as `tekagami-v1` JSONL. Deterministic data tools then turn the logs into endpoint summaries, behavior reports, compact AI/human review packs, and legacy-vs-target diffs.

tekagami is not an APM, and it does not infer business specifications. It records observed facts so people and AI workflows can reason from evidence.

## What You Get

- `tekagami.jsonl`: one request per line, with observed HTTP shapes, SQL timeline, custom events, effects, and capture errors.
- `summary.md/json`: an observed endpoint catalog for choosing investigation targets.
- `report.md/json`: grouped behavior patterns per endpoint, including status codes and SQL flows.
- `export.json/md`: a compact evidence pack for AI or human review, with SQL dictionary compression.
- `diff.json/md`: a deterministic legacy-vs-target comparison, including changed patterns and meaning-near SQL matches.
- Specification candidates: produced by the `spec/` workflow from observed evidence plus code, DDL, fixtures, config, and other context.
